I was a Computer Science student at the University of Washington, but after a year of taking classes that
I didn't find particulary interesting or useful I decided to drop out. I flew down to San Fransisco just for a chance at joining Wordware, and now that I am working there full time I think that was the best decision I have ever made.

I want to spend the coming years continuing to learn from the brilliant people I work with and building products that shape every aspect of our lives for years to come. I am extremely optimistic about the future we can build with AI, and I am doing everything in my power to contribute to the most important technological revolution of our generation.

## Background

I am pretty much a self taught developer. The intro to CS classes I took at UW have not had a major impact
on how I write code. I have learned by working on things I find awesome.

## Work

I am a full stack engineer at Wordware. However, being an early stage startup I do whatever I can to help
which requires me to wear many hats.

## Interests

Most of my time is spent working. However, when I am not working I like to lift, box, read and write.
